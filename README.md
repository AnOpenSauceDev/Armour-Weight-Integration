# Armour-Weight-Integration
An example mod for Armour Weight, intended for people who want to add-in compat for their own modded armour.

This example was written literally a year ago, so this doesn't provide anything with the new API's.

Anyways like and sub- ...I mean fork and watch, for absolutely no new updates.
